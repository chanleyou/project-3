Foodtruckr is an online platform for food truck and pop-up food store events. Users can search for events by location or topic of interest and order food online, while chefs can rent trucks to organise events, create menus and manage their orders.

## Technology

Foodtruckr was built with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. It uses a PostgreSQL server for storage. Other features include:

* Location search through Google Maps AI
* Smart search with autocomplete using Elasticsearch and Typeahead
